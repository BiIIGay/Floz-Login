            <p>Cube Slider, our debut work, follows a typical run game.<br/>
              However, we approached the game in a new way.<br/>
              Rather than making the level consisted of radnomized obstacles, we used handmade design.<br/>
              This kind if approach could results in laclking diversity in gameplay but this game doesnt.<br/> 
              With really fast-paced gameplay and stylish physical effect, the game doesn't feel repetitive or boring<br/> 
              Rather, the levels gives the feeling of learning every positions of obstacles.<br/>
              Thus, high color contrast and many other bold stylic choices, the game differentiates itself from other similar games.
