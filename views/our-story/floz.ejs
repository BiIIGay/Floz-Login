        </div>
        <p>
          FLOZ was founded in 2021 to develop softwares. In the same year, FLOZ's affiliate FLOZGAME was formed.
          In 2021, the first game was released by our subsidiary FLOZGAME.  
          Cube Slider, David's debut work, follows a typical run game. However, he approached the genre in a new way. 
          Rather than making the level consist of randomized obstacles, he used handmade design. 
          This kind of approach could result in lacking diversity in gameplay, but this game doesn't. 
          With really fast-paced gameplay and stylish physical effects, the game doesn't feel repetitive or boring. 
          Rather, the level gives the feeling of learning every position of obstacles. 
          Thus, high color contrast and many other bold stylistic choices, the game differentiates itself from other similar games.
          In addition, FLOZGAME gives student developers to upload their games to FLOZ site.
